# Peiran Wang @THU


I'm WhileBug(Peiran Wang, 王沛然), a student who is interested in AI Security (especially security for LLM recently), Machine Learning System, and PLSE. I am pursuing master degree in cybersecurity in Tsinghua University. I graduated from Sichuan University in Cybersecurity Talented Class in 2022. During my undergraduate, I got National Scholarship, and got GPA of 3.92 (rank 2/172). 

I organize [SCU-Leap-Manual](https://scu-cs-runner.github.io/SurviveSCUManual/) for CS/SE/Cybersecurity students in SCU, if you want to join us, please drop me an email😁.
